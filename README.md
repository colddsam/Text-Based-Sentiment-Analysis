<h1>Depression Analysis 1.0</h1>
<p>In this project I tried to make a LSTM model to analysis depression based text, for this I used rerddit message database from Kaggle. It has over 5000 message with positive and negative label. Positive means the text is depression based and negative means the text is normal.</p>
<h2>If you want to try this model then you have to do the following steps</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>
            STEP 1 : 
        </h3>
        <h4>
            First download the kaggle dataset from this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/infamouscoder/depression-reddit-cleaned">link</a> on your working directory.
        </h4>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>
            STEP 2 : 
        </h3>
        <h4>
            Change your current directory to the working directory.
        </h4>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>
            STEP 3 : 
        </h3>
        <h4>
            Install the modules and packages given in <b>requirements.txt</b>. You can do it by running a simple command from your terminal.<br><b><i>pip install -r requirements.txt</i></b>
        </h4>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>
            STEP 4 : 
        </h3>
        <h4>
            Then run training.ipynb the jupyter notebook cels one by one to train our model. After training the model will be save in depression_analysis_model.keras this name. You can change this name according to you
        </h4>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>
            STEP 5 :
        </h3>
        <h4>
            After training you can check your model practical performance from app.py file.
        </h4>
    </li>
</ul>
